# Personal Finance Spreadsheet Generator
As I grow more financially independent, I create tools for myself to keep track of 
important financial information. Since it was so helpful for me, I am sharing it with 
everyone.

I am automating the creation of Google Sheets workbooks using Spring Boot and will 
expose a front on my [personal website](https://www.cormac-taylor.com/) to allow 
customization. Functionality, it will include investment portfolio tracking & tools, 
budgeting, credit card stats, and credit score & net worth tracking.
